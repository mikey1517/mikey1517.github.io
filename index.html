    <h1>BAY AREA SPORTS NOW</h1>

    <p><img id="change" src="images/SF.png" alt="Nfl Symbol" width="200" height="300" align="right" /><p> The San Francisco 49ers turned a nearly historic collapse into a stunning victory and a playoff berth. </p>

    <img src="http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/extra_points/121712woodhead.jpg">
    <p>San Francisco withstood a 28-point comeback by the New England Patriots to win 41-34 on Sunday night in the rain. Michael Crabtree took a short pass from Colin Kaepernick and sped around cornerback Kyle Arrington for a 38-yard touchdown with 6:25 to go, then David Akers made a 28-yard field goal to clinch it.

"We can win a shootout," Crabtree said. "Whatever it takes, that's our motto. ... We feel like we can do anything, sky's the limit."</p>
    <p>The 49ers (10-3-1) own at least a wild-card spot and play at Seattle next week with a chance to win the NFC West. A loss would bring the division race down to the final weekend.

Kaepernick threw for four touchdowns, two to Crabtree, who had 107 yards receiving. The defense rattled Tom Brady at times, but also yielded 443 yards passing in a sloppy contest between two of the league's more precise teams.</p>

    <h3>San Francisco Giants</h3>
    <p>The Giants had scored three runs in the first inning against a hot starter, Yovani Gallardo, when Vogelsong came to bat with the bases loaded and two outs. He hit a strange cue shot to the left side that shortstop Jean Segura gloved on one hop.

Segura tried and failed to outrace Brandon Crawford to second base for an inning-ending force. It seemed the Giants had taken a 4-0 lead, except that Vogelsong stopped running, thinking that Crawford would be out. Segura, alerted to that fact, fired to first ahead of Vogelsong to end the inning, take a run off the board and ruin a chance for Hunter Pence to inflict a mortal wound.

"Stupid mistake on my part," Vogelsong said. "The thing that stunk the most was I cost Hunter a chance to hit with the bases loaded. It could have been a huge inning after that."

Bochy knows how emotional Vogelsong can be and saw how angry the pitcher was when he fired his helmet into the dugout. Bochy was sure Vogelsong took his anger to the mound, especially when Carlos Gomez hit a leadoff homer to cut the lead to 3-1.

Bochy was upset with Vogelsong's mistake, but at that moment, he had to be Mr. Positive Reinforcement.

"Boch said, 'Let it go. You've got a game to pitch,' " Vogelsong said. "That probably helped me more than anything. I'm sure he was mad at me. Hearing him say that reminded me I've got to get my head in the right place."

The result: six shutout innings after the home run against the league's second-most prolific offense and a 4-1 lead when he left after Segura ended the sixth with a long drive to center with two aboard.

The game then got hairy for the Giants. They led 4-3 after seven innings. Bochy, acknowledging the Vogelsong mistake and other wasted chances, said, "If we would have lost, we would have been sick about it." </p>
